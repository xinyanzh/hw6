instacart <- read_csv("../data/instacart_train_data.csv.zip")

#the selected department will be among the department which have the most order

We analysis the instacart dataset and produce the result as follows. To select a specific department, chart A is going to show the number of orders in different hours of a day in the chosen department. And chart B presents the distribution of order of 8 most popular products in the department over different hours of a day. Chart C conveys the distribution of order over the whole week of the chosen department. In addition, by choosing time range, chart A and C can change accordingly. 



```{r}
#selectinput widget
selectInput("department_choice", label = h3("Select department"),choices = popular_department, selected = "canned goods")

# sliderInput widget
sliderInput("time_choice", label = h3("Choose time range"), min =0,max = 24, step=1, round= True, value = c(8,17))

```

### Chart A

```{r}
# show the number of order in selected time range and selected department
renderPlotly({ 
  instacart%>%
    filter(department == input$department_choice,
           order_hour_of_day %in% input$time_choice[1]:input$time_choice[2],
)%>%
    group_by(order_hour_of_day)%>%
    summarize(number_of_order=n())%>%
    mutate(text_label = str_c("Hour:", order_hour_of_day, '\nNumber of order ', number_of_order)) %>% 
    plot_ly(x= ~order_hour_of_day, y=~number_of_order,type="bar")  
  
})

```

### Chart C
